## Overview

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. By analyzing transaction data and applying logistic regression, we can identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activity and mitigate risks for both cardholders and financial institutions.

## Project Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between different variables, identify patterns, and gain insights into the dataset.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features or modified existing ones to improve the model's performance.
   - This involved transforming variables, creating interaction terms, or encoding categorical variables as necessary.

3. **Data Splitting**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - The training set was used to train the model, while the testing set was used to evaluate its performance.
     
4. **Data Sampling**:
   - Balanced the chosen target variables using data sampling techniques to address class imbalance issues.

5. **Model Selection**:
   - Chose logistic regression as the appropriate machine learning algorithm for the problem.
   - Logistic regression is a common algorithm for binary classification tasks like fraud detection.

6. **Model Training**:
   - Trained the logistic regression model using the training dataset.
   - Fed the algorithm with features and corresponding labels and let it learn the patterns in the data.

7. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model's performance on the testing dataset using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Achieved a model accuracy score of 92%, indicating the model's effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.
